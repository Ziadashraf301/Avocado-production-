# Avocado-production-

In this notebook, I will explain the problems represented in the data visualizations and how to solve them and reconstruct the right visual, which can lead to the correct insights and not distract the eyes of the audience from reality and the correct patterns. Our example is avocado production between the countries over time in metric tonnes. The chart shows which country was the largest producer of avocados until 2020, and how many tons of avocados this country produced. It also provides a comparison between the top-producing countries and shows the differences between their productions over time. I will scrape the data from Wikipedia to reconstruct the chart and get the correct insights.
